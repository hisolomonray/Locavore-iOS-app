#### Description:
The Locavore SwiftUI iOS App is a user-friendly application designed entirely using SwiftUI, without relying on external libraries or frameworks. The app aims to assist users in discovering and connecting with local restaurants, coffee shops, and wine bars in their area, with a focus on promoting locally sourced ingredients and supporting local businesses.

Key Features:

1. **Yelp API Integration**: The Locavore app leverages the Yelp API to fetch comprehensive data about various establishments, including restaurant names, contact information, addresses, operating hours, and photos.

2. **Dual Search Functionality**: The app provides an intuitive user interface with two search bars, implemented using SwiftUI. The first search bar allows users to enter specific food categories (e.g., Italian, Mexican, vegan) to refine their search results. The second search bar enables users to input their location, whether it's a specific address, city, or their current GPS location.

3. **Comprehensive Establishment Listings**: Locavore presents users with a list of establishments based on their search criteria, utilizing SwiftUI views to display detailed information such as address, phone number, operating hours, menu items, and special offers.

4. **Smart Sorting and Filtering**: The app incorporates smart sorting and filtering options, implemented using SwiftUI, to enhance the user experience. Users can sort the search results based on different parameters like rating, distance, or popularity. They can also apply filters to refine their search based on specific preferences such as price range, dietary restrictions, or cuisine type.

5. **Map Integration**: Locavore integrates maps using SwiftUI's MapKit integration to display the locations of nearby establishments. Users can visualize the proximity of different options, view markers on the map, and obtain directions to their chosen destination.

The Locavore SwiftUI iOS App aims to provide a seamless and efficient way for users to explore and connect with local food, coffee, and wine establishments. It leverages the power of SwiftUI to create a visually appealing and intuitive user interface while promoting locally sourced ingredients and supporting local businesses.
